/*
Help me to make: 
- a React app with a countdown timer

The project name is: react-demo-1

Give me the above instructions, but use only shell commands.
No need to give further explanation.
All of your output should be given as a single bash script.
For example, when want to edit a file, use the command `echo "file contents" > filename.ext`.
Before using a command, use commands to install the command if necessary.
Create a git repo before running any commands.
Before changing any files in the repository, make an initial git commit.
After each and every bash command make a commit with a detailed commit message.
Do not start the app when you are finished.
